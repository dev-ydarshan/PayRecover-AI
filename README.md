# PayRecover AI — Explainable Revenue Recovery Agent

**Razorpay Buildathon 2026 — Track 3**

When a payment fails, most businesses do one of two things: write it off, or
pay a call centre to chase every failure identically. Both are wrong. Chasing
a ₹200 subscription with a phone call costs more than the payment is worth;
sending a ₹20,000 B2B invoice a templated SMS wastes the relationship.

This agent reads a batch of failed payments, diagnoses each one, and picks the
**cheapest recovery action that will actually work** — from a seven-rule table
you can read, not a model you have to trust. It refuses to act when a stopping
rule says no, and it writes down every decision, every send, and every refusal.

> **The one-sentence constitution:** *every rupee recovered traces back to a
> rule you can read.*

On the sample batch of 40 failed payments (₹67,382 at risk), a single pass
recovers **₹4,941 for ₹24.35 of outreach** — before a human contacts anyone.

## Try it without installing anything

**Live dashboard:** _<paste your Streamlit Cloud URL here>_

Nothing to install, no account, no keys. That is the intended way to look at
this project.

If you want to verify the decision logic on your own machine, it takes two
commands and **no database and no credentials**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python decision_engine.py     # the full seven-rule engine, off the bundled CSVs
python test_agent.py          # 56 tests, none of them need credentials
```

`decision_engine.py` prints a tier and a one-sentence reason for all 40
payments. That is the whole claim of this project, verifiable in 30 seconds.

The full install below is only needed if you want the live dashboard and the
audit trail running against your own database.

## How it works

```
   failed payment
         |
         v
   decide_tier()          seven ordered rules -> a tier, plus the
         |                one-sentence reason. Both written to audit_log.
         v
   interventions row      outcome: pending
         |
         v
   stopping_rules.check() re-reads the payment NOW, not at decision time:
         |                already paid? attempts used up? outside call hours?
         v
   channel executor       auto_retry | whatsapp | voice_call
         |                each one gated behind DRY_RUN
         v
   audit_log              what was sent — or which rule refused to send it
         |
         v
   mark_recovered()       payment -> recovered, credited to the tier that
                          earned it
```

The design decision worth calling out: **the stopping rules run twice.** Once
when the tier is chosen, and again immediately before anything fires. Those are
different moments, and a customer may have paid in between. The second check is
what stops you texting someone who already settled up.

---

## The three tiers

Cost-ordered. The agent escalates only when a rule says the cheaper tier will
not do.

| Tier | What it does | Indicative cost | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Auto-retry** | Silent gateway re-presentment. No customer contact at all. | ₹0 | Retryable failure (bank timeout, processing error) on its first attempt |
| **WhatsApp** | Templated nudge carrying a payment link. | ~₹0.35 | The default for customer-action failures — expired card, insufficient funds |
| **Voice call** | Hinglish call that captures a verbal promise to pay, returned as structured JSON. | ~₹4.50 | High-value payments, and repeat B2B invoice failures |

Costs are assumptions used to show the ordering, not billed rates.

---

## The rules

Checked in order. **First match wins.** That is the entire explanation — and
the matching line is what gets written to the audit trail.

| # | If | Then | Because |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | the payment is no longer failed | `skip` | already resolved |
| 2 | it is flagged as fraud risk | `manual_review` | no automated contact, ever |
| 3 | 3 contact attempts already made | `manual_review` | stopping rule: the cap is reached |
| 4 | retryable failure, first attempt | **`auto_retry`** | a silent retry costs nothing and often works |
| 5 | B2B invoice ≥ ₹5,000, or failed twice | **`voice_call`** | high value or repeat failure needs a human touch |
| 6 | customer must act and it is ≥ ₹5,000 | **`voice_call`** | worth a call, not just a text |
| 7 | anything else | **`whatsapp`** | the low-cost default nudge |

**Why a rules table and not a model.** The deliverable is a *defensible*
decision, not a marginally more accurate one. When a compliance officer — or an
annoyed customer — asks "why did you call me?", there is exactly one line to
point at. A black box cannot do that. With ten million payments behind it, the
thresholds are exactly where you would tune it.

---

## The stopping rules

Enforced when the tier is chosen **and re-checked immediately before anything
fires**.

| Rule | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| **Already paid** | Never contact someone who has settled. Status is re-read at execution time, not trusted from the decision. |
| **Max 3 contact attempts** | Hard cap per payment. Silent auto-retries do **not** count — they never reach the customer. |
| **9am–9pm calling window** | TRAI-aligned. Outside it the voice tier is downgraded to WhatsApp when deciding, and deferred when executing. |
| **Fraud-flagged** | No automated contact at all. |
| **No longer failed** | Anything that left the recovery funnel is dropped. |

Every refusal becomes an `intervention_skipped` row naming the exact rule, so
**declining to act is as auditable as acting.**

Each run of `run_pipeline.py` is one recovery *round*. Run it repeatedly and
the cap shuts the whole thing down on its own:

```
round 1    6 auto-retry, 31 WhatsApp, 3 voice
round 2   30 WhatsApp, 3 voice          (recovered ones drop out)
round 3   30 WhatsApp, 3 voice
round 4    0 customer contact           <- the 3-attempt cap has closed it
```

---

## Dry run — why nothing actually sends

`DRY_RUN` defaults to **true**, and it is a design constraint rather than a
placeholder.

| `DRY_RUN=true` (default) | `DRY_RUN=false` |
|---|---|
| The exact message or call script is composed in full | The real Twilio / Bolna APIs are called |
| Written to `audit_log` as `whatsapp_dry_run`, `voice_dry_run` | Written as `whatsapp_sent`, `voice_call_completed` |
| Intervention marked executed, so recovery maths works | Marked from the real provider response |
| **No third-party credentials needed** | Real, verified credentials required |

This exists because the project hit a real wall: Twilio requires an approved
Content Template for WhatsApp sends outside the 24-hour session window, and
those are gated behind a paid account upgrade. A demo must never depend on
somebody's KYC queue finishing on time.

The live code paths are complete, not stubs — flip the flag and the same
functions send for real. **Every simulated row is stamped `simulated: true`**
in its audit payload, so a dry-run number can never be mistaken for a real one.

## Install and run

### What you need

- **Python 3.11 or newer** (`python --version`)
- **A free Supabase account** — [supabase.com](https://supabase.com). This is
  the only external service required.

No Twilio, Bolna or Razorpay account is needed to run this project.

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ai-revenue-recovery.git
cd ai-revenue-recovery

python -m venv .venv
# macOS / Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows PowerShell:
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Create a Supabase project

1. Go to [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard) → **New project**.
2. Wait for it to finish provisioning (about a minute).
3. Open **Project Settings → API** and copy two things:
   - the **Project URL** (`https://xxxx.supabase.co`)
   - the **`service_role`** key — *not* the `anon` key

### 3. Create the tables

Supabase's API does not accept schema changes, so this one step is manual:

1. Open your project → **SQL Editor** → **New query**
2. Paste the entire contents of [`schema.sql`](schema.sql)
3. Press **Run**

That creates four tables and the `recovery_metrics` view.

### 4. Run setup — it asks for your keys

```bash
python setup_database.py
```

It prompts for your **Project URL** and **secret key** (both from Project
Settings → API), writes `.env` for you, verifies the tables, and loads 15
customers and 40 failed payments. No file editing needed.

> `.env` is gitignored. Never commit it.

### 5. Run it

```bash
python run_pipeline.py
```

Decides a tier for all 40 payments, then executes all three tiers in dry run.
About 45 seconds.

### 6. Open the dashboard

```bash
python -m streamlit run dashboard.py
```

Your browser opens at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Daily use

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `python run_pipeline.py` | One full recovery round: decide → auto-retry → WhatsApp → voice |
| `python run_pipeline.py --skip-decide` | Execute pending interventions without starting a new round |
| `python -m streamlit run dashboard.py` | The dashboard |
| `python reset_demo.py --yes` | Clear interventions and audit log, put every payment back to failed |
| `python outcome_tracker.py --list` | Show payments that can be marked recovered |
| `python outcome_tracker.py <payment-id>` | Mark one as paid from the CLI |
| `python setup_database.py --check` | Verify the database without changing it |
| `python test_agent.py` | Run the test suite |

The dashboard has a **Mark as paid** control that fires the same
`mark_recovered()` a real Razorpay `payment.captured` webhook would call, so
you can move the recovery rate live.

---

## Tests

```bash
python test_agent.py          # no pytest needed
pytest test_agent.py -q       # or with pytest, if you have it
```

**56 tests, and none of them need credentials.** That is deliberate: clone this
repo with no `.env` at all and you can still verify every claim this README
makes about the rules and the stopping rules. Nothing in the suite touches
Supabase or any third-party API.

| Area | What is asserted |
|---|---|
| `DRY_RUN` | Defaults to true — if this ever flips, a demo run messages real people |
| Rules | One test per rule, in order, plus precedence (fraud beats high-value) |
| Reasons | No rule may return an empty explanation — the audit trail depends on it |
| Contact accounting | `auto_retry` never burns one of the 3 permitted contacts |
| Call window | Daytime, late night, early morning, and both 9:00 / 21:00 edges |
| Stopping rules | Already-paid, written-off, vanished, at-cap, defer-outside-hours |
| WhatsApp dry run | Sends nothing, fabricates no message id, body carries amount + link + opt-out |
| Voice dry run | Returns structure not a transcript; deterministic; survives junk from a provider |
| Theme | Contrast on text, on control borders, and on the darkest pixel the background texture can produce |

## Going live

Everything below is optional — the project runs fully without any of it.

**WhatsApp.** Set `DRY_RUN=false` and add `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` /
`TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`. On a trial account, use the WhatsApp Sandbox: send
`join <your-code>` to the sandbox number from your own phone, which opens a
24-hour window in which free-form messages are delivered without a template.
Point it at your own number — the sample customer numbers are randomly
generated and will fail.

**Voice.** Add `BOLNA_API_KEY` and `BOLNA_AGENT_ID` (or the Vapi equivalents).
The provider is auto-detected from whichever key is present; force it with
`VOICE_PROVIDER=bolna|vapi`. The agent runs a promise-to-pay script and returns
structured JSON, which lands in `interventions.promise_to_pay_date`.

**Payment links.** `PAYMENT_LINK_BASE` defaults to a stub that does not
resolve. Point it at a real Razorpay Payment Link before showing the message to
anyone.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `SUPABASE_URL / SUPABASE_KEY are not set` | You have no `.env`. Run `cp .env.example .env` and fill in both values. |
| `missing tables: ...` | Step 4 was skipped. Paste `schema.sql` into the Supabase SQL editor and run it. |
| `Invalid API key` | You probably copied the `anon` key. Use **`service_role`**. |
| `recovery_metrics view is missing` | Run the last statement in `schema.sql` — the dashboard needs it. |
| Dashboard shows nothing | Run `python run_pipeline.py` first, then hit **Refresh**. |
| Voice tier reports 0 calls | You are outside the 9am–9pm window. That is the stopping rule working correctly. |
| `streamlit: command not found` | Use `python -m streamlit run dashboard.py`. |
| Theme looks wrong after editing | `.streamlit/config.toml` loads only at startup — restart Streamlit. |
| Numbers do not match the demo script | Someone ran a second round. `python reset_demo.py --yes`, then `python run_pipeline.py`. |

---

## Notes and limitations

- **The auto-retry gateway is a stub.** There is no real payment gateway
  integration; re-presentment is simulated deterministically, seeded from the
  payment id so results are reproducible. Simulated captures do mark the
  payment recovered, and are stamped `simulated: true`.
- **`recovery_rate_pct` is count-based** (recovered payments ÷ total payments).
  The dashboard shows the value-weighted rate next to it, because the two
  differ whenever recovered payments are larger or smaller than average.
- **Blocked interventions are stored as `failed`.** The deployed `outcome`
  constraint permits only `pending | success | failed`; the rule that refused
  is recorded in `notes` and in the audit trail.
  [`migration_add_skipped_outcome.sql`](migration_add_skipped_outcome.sql) adds
  a distinct `skipped` value if you want one.
- **Not built, deliberately:** a real Razorpay webhook listener.
  `mark_recovered()` is exactly the function it would call.
